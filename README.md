# Hi! I'm Luca, and these are my repositories.

I work as a PhD student at the University of Turin, Italy in the Complex Systems for Life Sciences program.
I'm a bioinformatician, working with everything genomic and transcriptomic related. I'm currently focusing on the role of the transportome in Cancer.

I'm the maintainer for all packages in [my laboratory's organization](https://github.com/CMA-Lab).

If you're interested, take a look at [my ABOUT page](https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/about/). It contains more information on what I do, as well as my Curriculum Vitae and publication lists.

## Contacts
All my contacts live in [my linktree](https://linktr.ee/mrhedmad). I strive to keep it up-to-date!
