### I'm Luca, and these are my repositories.

I work as a PhD student at the [University of Turin](https://www.unito.it/), Italy in the Complex Systems for Life Sciences program.
I'm a bioinformatician, working with everything genomic and transcriptomic related.

I'm an author and the maintainer for (almost) all packages in [my laboratory's organization](https://github.com/TCP-Lab).

If you want to learn more about me, take a look at [my ABOUT page](https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/about/).
It contains more information on what I do, as well as my Curriculum Vitae and publication lists.

I really like collaborating with others. If you want to collaborate, check the CONTRIBUTING files
in the repository for the project you want to contribute to, or contact me directly!

I administrate [bioinfo.ds](https://discord.com/invite/arPBahn8N6), a bioniformatics-centered community on Discord.

### 📨 Contact Me
