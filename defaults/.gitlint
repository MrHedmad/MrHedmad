# Some explaination and guide on the `conventional commits` types that I use.
#
# - `new` : When there is a **completely new** addition to the codebase.
#           a new file, a new module, a new function, anything new.
#           A synonym for this is `feat`, but I prefer `new`.
# - `edit`: Edit something. This is the controversial one: what does it mean to
#           'edit' something? I used to constanly have to label everything as
#           'feat' even though most of my changes are just that - changes.
#           A computation is switched out for another (not a fix, not a feat...),
# - `fix` : Something was not working, it is (hopefully) working now.
# - `ref` : Refactoring. Nothing functional has changed, just the structure of
#           the code, the folder structure or the code style.
# - `docs`: Something in the documentation changed, such as the README.
# - `test`: Additions, removals or changes in the testing of the software.
# - `ci`  : Stuff regarding Continuous Integration or chores to run CI, or
#           changes to version numbers or other chores.
# - `perf`: The code runs faster now. Zoom zoom.
